accusing the Montgomery police, and hence him, of answering Dr. King's protests
with &quot;intimidation and violence,&quot; bombing his home, assaulting his
person, and charging him with perjury. Respondent and six other Montgomery

the statements contained in the paragraphs were not accurate descriptions of
events which occurred in Montgomery. Although Negro students staged a
demonstration on the State Capitol steps, they sang the National Anthem and not
&quot;My 259 Country, 'Tis of Thee.&quot; Although nine students were expelled
by the State Board of Education, this was not for leading the demonstration at
the Capitol, but for demanding service at a lunch counter in the Montgomery
County Courthouse on another day. Not the entire student body, but most of it,
had protested the expulsion, not by refusing to register, but by boycotting
classes on a single day; virtually all the students did register for the
ensuing semester. The campus dining hall was not padlocked on any occasion, and
the only students who may have been barred from eating there were the few who
had neither signed a preregistration application nor requested temporary meal
tickets. Although the police were deployed near the campus in large numbers on
three occasions, they did not at any time &quot;ring&quot; the campus, and they
were not called to the campus in connection with the demonstration on the State
Capitol steps, as the third paragraph implied. Dr. King had not been arrested
seven times, but only four; and although he claimed to have been assaulted some
years earlier in connection with his arrest for loitering outside a courtroom,
one of the officers who made the arrest denied that there was such an assault.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

the sixth paragraph could be read as referring to him, respondent was allowed
to prove that he had not participated in the events described. Although Dr.
King's home had in fact been bombed twice when his wife and child were there,
both of these occasions antedated respondent's tenure as Commissioner, and the
police were not only not implicated in the bombings, but had made every effort
to apprehend those who were. Three of Dr. King's four arrests took place before
respondent became Commissioner. Although Dr. King had in fact been indicted (he

five-year sentence, respondent had nothing to do with procuring the indictment.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

approximately $4800, and it was published by the Times upon an order from a New
York advertising agency acting for the signatory Committee. The agency
submitted the advertisement with a letter from A. Philip Randolph, Chairman of
the Committee, certifying that the persons whose names appeared on the
advertisement had given their permission. Mr. Randolph was known to the Times'
Advertising Acceptability Department as a responsible person, and in accepting
the letter as sufficient proof of authorization it followed its established
practice. There was testimony that the copy of the advertisement which
accompanied the letter listed only the 64 names appearing under the text, and
that the statement, &quot;We in the south . . . warmly endorse this
appeal,&quot; and the list of names thereunder, which included those of the
individual petitioners, were subsequently added when the first proof of the
advertisement was received. Each of the individual petitioners testified that
he had not authorized the use of his name, and that he had been unaware of its
use until receipt of respondent's demand for a retraction. The manager of the
Advertising Acceptability 261 Department testified that he had approved the
advertisement for publication because he knew nothing to cause him to believe
that anything in it was false, and because it bore the endorsement of &quot;a
number of people who are well known and whose reputation&quot; he &quot;had no
reason to question.&quot; Neither he nor anyone else at the Times made an
effort to confirm the accuracy of the advertisement, either by checking it
against recent Times news stories relating to some of the described events or
by any other means.<o:p></o:p></span></p>

recovery of punitive damages in a libel action brought on account of a
publication concerning his official conduct unless he first makes a written
demand for a public retraction and the defendant fails or refuses to comply.
Alabama Code, Tit. 7, § 914. Respondent served such a demand upon each of the
petitioners. None of the individual petitioners responded to the demand,
primarily because each took the position that he had not authorized the use of
his name on the advertisement and therefore had not published the statements
that respondent alleged had libeled him. The Times did not publish a retraction
in response to the demand, but wrote respondent a letter stating, among other
things, that &quot;we . . . are somewhat puzzled as to how you think the
statements in any way reflect on you,&quot; and &quot;you might, if you desire,
let us know in what respect you claim that the statements in the advertisement
reflect on you.&quot; Respondent filed this suit a few days later without
answering the letter. The Times did, however, subsequently publish a retraction
of the advertisement upon the demand of Governor John Patterson of Alabama, who
asserted that the publication charged him with &quot;grave misconduct and . . .
improper actions and omissions as Governor of Alabama and Ex-Officio Chairman
of the State Board of Education of Alabama.&quot; When asked to explain why
there had been a retraction for the Governor but not for respondent, the 262
Secretary of the Times testified: &quot;We did that because we didn't want anything
that was published by The Times to be a reflection on the State of Alabama and
the Governor was, as far as we could see, the embodiment of the State of

to the jury under instructions that the statements in the advertisement were
&quot;libelous per se&quot; and were not privileged, so that petitioners might
be held liable if the jury found that they had published the advertisement and

jury was instructed that, because the statements were libelous <i>per se,</i>
&quot;the law . . . implies legal injury from the bare fact of publication
itself,&quot; &quot;falsity and malice are presumed,&quot; &quot;general
damages need not be alleged or proved but are presumed,&quot; and
&quot;punitive damages may be awarded by the jury even though the amount of
actual damages is neither found nor shown.&quot; An award of punitive
damages—as distinguished from &quot;general&quot; damages, which are
compensatory in nature—apparently requires proof of actual malice under Alabama
law, and the judge charged that &quot;mere negligence or carelessness is not
evidence of actual malice or malice in fact, and does not justify an award of
exemplary or punitive damages.&quot; He refused to charge, however, that the
jury must be &quot;convinced&quot; of malice, in the sense of &quot;actual
intent&quot; to harm or &quot;gross negligence and recklessness,&quot; to make
such an award, and he also refused to require that a verdict for respondent
differentiate between compensatory and punitive damages. The judge rejected
petitioners' contention 263 that his rulings abridged the freedoms of speech

profession, trade or business, or charge him with an indictable offense, or
tend to bring the individual into public contempt,&quot; they are
&quot;libelous per se&quot;; that &quot;the matter complained of is, under the

find the statements to have been made &quot;of and concerning&quot; respondent,
stating: &quot;We think it common knowledge that the average person knows that
municipal agents, such as police and firemen, and others, are under the control
and direction of the city governing body, and more particularly under the
direction and control of a single commissioner. In measuring the performance or
deficiencies of such groups, praise or criticism is usually attached to the
official in complete control of the body.&quot; <i>Id.,</i> at 674-675, 144 So.

not excessive, the court said that malice could be inferred from the Times'
&quot;irresponsibility&quot; in printing the advertisement while &quot;the
Times in its own files had articles already published which would have
demonstrated the falsity of the allegations in the advertisement&quot;; from
the Times' failure to retract for respondent while retracting for the Governor,
whereas the falsity of some of the allegations was then known to the Times and
&quot;the matter contained in the advertisement was equally false as to both
parties&quot;; and from the testimony of the Times' Secretary that, 264 apart
from the statement that the dining hall was pad-locked, he thought the two paragraphs
were &quot;substantially correct.&quot; <i>Id.,</i> at 686-687, 144 So. 2d at

is no legal measure of damages in cases of this character.&quot; <i>Id.,</i> at

grounds asserted to insulate the judgment of the Alabama courts from
constitutional scrutiny. The first is the proposition relied on by the State
Supreme Court—that &quot;The Fourteenth Amendment is directed against State
action and not private action.&quot; That proposition has no application to
this case. Although this is a civil lawsuit between private parties, the
Alabama courts have applied a state rule of law which petitioners claim to
impose invalid restrictions on their constitutional freedoms of speech and
press. It matters not that that law has been applied in a civil action and that
it is common law only, though supplemented by statute. See, <i>e. g.,</i>
Alabama Code, Tit. 7, §§ 908-917. The test is not the form in which state power
has been applied but, whatever the form, whether such power has in fact been
exercised. See <a

constitutional guarantees of freedom of speech and of the press are
inapplicable here, at least so far as the Times is concerned, because the
allegedly libelous statements were published as part of a paid, &quot;commercial&quot;

official action on the other. The reliance is wholly misplaced. The Court in <i>Chrestensen</i>
reaffirmed the constitutional protection for &quot;the freedom of communicating

statements that reflect upon the agency of which he is in charge. Once
&quot;libel per se&quot; has been established, the defendant has no defense as
to stated facts unless he can persuade the jury that they were true in all
their particulars. <i>Alabama Ride Co.</i> v. <i>Vance,</i> 235 Ala. 263, 178

Unless he can discharge the burden of proving truth, general damages are
presumed, and may be awarded without proof of pecuniary injury. A showing of
actual malice is apparently a prerequisite to recovery of punitive damages, and
the defendant may in any event forestall a punitive award by a retraction
meeting the statutory requirements. Good motives and belief in truth do not
negate an inference of malice, but are relevant only in mitigation of punitive
damages if the jury chooses to accord them weight. <a
