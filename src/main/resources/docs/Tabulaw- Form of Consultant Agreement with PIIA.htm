<br>Confidential Information and Intellectual Property Assignment Agreement
<br>
As a condition of my independent contracting relationship with Tabulaw, Inc., its subsidiaries, affiliates, successors
or assigns (together the "Company"), and in consideration of my independent contracting relationship with the Company
and my receipt of the compensation now and hereafter paid to me by Company, I agree to the following terms under this
Confidential Information and Intellectual Property Assignment Agreement (the "Intellectual Property Agreement"):
<br>
<br>1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Confidential Information</span>.
<br>
<br>
(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Company Information</span>.&nbsp; I agree at all times during the term of my independent contracting
relationship with the Company (my "Relationship with the Company") and thereafter to hold in strictest confidence, and
not to use except for the benefit of the Company or to disclose to any person, firm or corporation without written
authorization of the Board of Directors of the Company, any Confidential Information of the Company.&nbsp; I understand
that "Confidential Information" means any Company proprietary information, technical data, trade secrets or know-how,
including, but not limited to, research, product plans, products, services, customer lists and customers (including, but
not limited to, customers of the Company on whom I called or with whom I became acquainted during the term of my
Relationship with the Company), markets, works of original authorship, photographs, negatives, digital images, software,
computer programs, know-how, ideas, developments, inventions (whether or not patentable), processes, formulas,
technology, designs, drawings, engineering, hardware configuration information, forecasts, strategies, marketing,
finances or other business information disclosed to me by the Company either directly or indirectly in writing, orally
or by drawings or observation or inspection of parts or equipment.&nbsp; Notwithstanding the foregoing, I further
understand that Confidential Information does not include any of the foregoing items which has become publicly known and
made generally available through no wrongful act of mine or of others who were under confidentiality obligations as to
the item or items involved.
<br>
<br>
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Other Employer Information</span>.&nbsp; I agree that I will not, during my Relationship with the
Company, improperly use or disclose any proprietary information or trade secrets of any former or concurrent employer or
other person or entity and that I will not bring onto the premises of the Company any unpublished document or
proprietary information belonging to any such employer, person or entity unless consented to in writing by such
employer, person or entity.
<br>
<br>
(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Third Party Information</span>.&nbsp; I recognize that the Company has received and in the future will
receive from third parties their confidential or proprietary information subject to a duty on the Company's part to
maintain the confidentiality of such information and to use it only for certain limited purposes.&nbsp; I agree to hold
all such confidential or proprietary information in the strictest confidence and not to disclose it to any person, firm
or corporation or to use it except as necessary in carrying out my work for the Company consistent with the Company's
agreement with such third party.
<br>
<br>2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Intellectual Property</span>.
<br>
<br>
(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Assignment of Intellectual Property</span>.&nbsp; I agree that I will promptly make full written
disclosure to the Company, will hold in trust for the sole right and benefit of the Company, and hereby assign to the
Company, or its designee, all my right, title, and interest in and to any original works of authorship, inventions,
concepts, improvements or trade secrets, whether or not patentable or registrable under copyright or similar laws, which
I may solely or jointly conceive or develop or reduce to practice, or cause to be conceived or developed or reduced to
practice, during the period of time I am in the service of the Company (collectively referred to as "Intellectual
Property") and which (i) are developed using the equipment, supplies, facilities or Confidential Information of the
Company, (ii) result from or are suggested by work performed by me for the Company, or (iii) relate to the business, or
to the actual or demonstrably anticipated research or development of the Company. The Intellectual Property will be the
sole and exclusive property of the Company.&nbsp; I further acknowledge that all original works of authorship which are
made by me (solely or jointly with others) within the scope of and during the period of my Relationship with the Company
and which are protectable by copyright are "works made for hire," as that term is defined in the United States Copyright
Act.&nbsp; To the extent that any Intellectual Property is not deemed to be work for hire, then I will and hereby do
assign all my right, title and interest in such Intellectual Property to the Company, except as provided in Section
2(e).
<br>
<br>
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Patent and Copyright Registrations</span>.&nbsp; I agree to assist the Company, or its designee, at the
Company's expense, in every proper way to secure the Company's rights in the Intellectual Property and any copyrights,
patents or other intellectual property rights relating thereto in any and all countries, including the disclosure to the
Company of all pertinent information and data with respect thereto, the execution of all applications, specifications,
oaths, assignments and all other instruments which the Company shall deem necessary in order to apply for and obtain
such rights and in order to assign and convey to the Company, its successors, assigns, and nominees the sole and
exclusive rights, title and interest in and to such Intellectual Property, and any copyrights, patents or other
intellectual property rights relating thereto.&nbsp; I further agree that my obligation to execute or cause to be
executed, when it is in my power to do so, any such instrument or papers shall continue after the termination of this
Intellectual Property Agreement.&nbsp; If the Company is unable because of my mental or physical incapacity or for any
other reason to secure my assistance in perfecting the rights transferred in this Intellectual Property Agreement, then
I hereby irrevocably designate and appoint the Company and its duly authorized officers and agents as my agent and
attorney in fact, to act for and in my behalf and stead to execute and file any such applications and to do all other
lawfully permitted acts to further the prosecution and issuance of letters patent or copyright registrations thereon
with the same legal force and effect as if executed by me.&nbsp; The designation and appointment of the Company and its
duly authorized officers and agents as my agent and attorney in fact shall be deemed to be coupled with an interest and
therefore irrevocable.
<br>
<br>
(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Maintenance of Records</span>.&nbsp; I agree to keep and maintain adequate and current written records of
all Intellectual Property made by me (solely or jointly with others) during the term of my Relationship with the
Company.&nbsp; The records will be in the form of notes, sketches, drawings, and works of original authorship,
photographs, negatives, digital images or any other format that may be specified by the Company.&nbsp; The records will
be available to and remain the sole property of the Company at all times.
<br>
<br>
(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Intellectual Property Retained and Licensed</span>.&nbsp; I provide below a list of all original works of
authorship, inventions, developments, improvements, and trade secrets which were made by me prior to my Relationship
with the Company (collectively referred to as "Prior Intellectual Property"), which belong to me, which relate to the
Company's proposed business, products or research and development, and which are not assigned to the Company hereunder;
or, if no such list is attached, I represent that there is no such Prior Intellectual Property.&nbsp; If in the course
of my Relationship with the Company, I incorporate into Company property any Prior Intellectual Property owned by me or
in which I have an interest, the Company is hereby granted and shall have a nonexclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable,
perpetual, worldwide license to make, have made, modify, use and sell such Prior Intellectual Property as part of or in
connection with such Company property.
<br>
<br>
Prior Intellectual Property:
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
<br>
<br>
(e)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Exception to Assignments</span>.&nbsp; I understand that the provisions of this Intellectual Property
Agreement requiring assignment of Intellectual Property to the Company do not apply to any intellectual property that

trade secret information; and (iii) do not result from any work performed by me for the Company; and (iv) do not relate
at the time of conception or reduction to practice to the Company's current or anticipated business, or to its actual or
demonstrably anticipated research or development.&nbsp; Any such intellectual property will be owned entirely by me,
even if developed by me during the time period in which I am in the service of the Company.&nbsp; I will advise the
Company promptly in writing of any intellectual property that I believe meet the criteria for exclusion set forth herein
and are not otherwise disclosed pursuant to Section 2(d) above.
<br>
<br>
(f)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Return of Company Documents</span>.&nbsp; I agree that, at the time of leaving the service of the
Company, I will deliver to the Company (and will not keep in my possession, recreate or deliver to anyone else) any and
all works of original authorship, photographs, negatives, digital images, devices, records, data, notes, reports,
proposals, lists, correspondence, specifications, drawings blueprints, sketches, materials, equipment, other documents
or property, or reproductions of any aforementioned items developed by me pursuant to my consulting Relationship with
the Company or otherwise belonging to the Company, its successors or assigns.&nbsp; In the event of the termination of
my Relationship with the Company, I agree to sign and deliver the "Termination Certificate" attached hereto as Appendix
A.
<br>
<br>3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Notification of New Employer</span>.&nbsp; In the event that I leave the service of the Company, I hereby
grant consent to notification by the Company to my new employer or consulting client about my rights and obligations
under this Intellectual Property Agreement.
<br>
<br>4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">No Solicitation of Employees</span>.&nbsp; In consideration for my Relationship with the Company and other
valuable consideration, receipt of which is hereby acknowledged, I agree that during the period of my Relationship with
the Company and for a period of twelve (12) months thereafter I shall not solicit the employment of any person who shall
then be employed by the Company (as an employee or consultant) or who shall have been employed by the Company (as an
employee or consultant) within the prior twelve (12) month period, on behalf of myself or any other person, firm,
corporation, association or other entity, directly or indirectly.
<br>
<br>5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Representations</span>.&nbsp; I represent that my performance of all the terms of this Intellectual
Property Agreement will not breach any agreement to keep in confidence proprietary information acquired by me in
confidence or in trust prior to my Relationship with the Company.&nbsp; I have not entered into, and I agree I will not
enter into, any oral or written agreement in conflict herewith.&nbsp; I agree to execute any proper oath or verify any
proper document required to carry out the terms of this Intellectual Property Agreement.
<br>
6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Arbitration and Equitable Relief.
<br>
<br>
(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Arbitration</span>. Except as provided in Section (b) below, I agree that any dispute or controversy
arising out of or relating to any interpretation, construction, performance or breach of this Intellectual Property
Agreement, shall be settled by arbitration to be held in San Francisco, California, in accordance with the rules then in
effect of the American Arbitration Association, provided, however, the parties will be entitled to full and liberal
evidentiary discovery in accordance with the rules governing civil litigation in courts of the same jurisdiction..&nbsp;
The arbitrator may grant injunctions or other relief in such dispute or controversy. The decision of the arbitrator
shall be final, conclusive and binding on the parties to the arbitration. Judgment may be entered on the arbitrator's
decision in any court having jurisdiction.&nbsp; The Company will pay the costs and expenses of such arbitration, and
each of us shall separately pay our counsel fees and expenses.
<br>
<br>
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Equitable Remedies</span>.&nbsp;&nbsp; Each of the Company and I agree that disputes relating to or
arising out of a breach of the covenants contained in this Intellectual Property Agreement would likely require
injunctive relief to maintain the status quo of the parties pending the appointment of an arbitrator pursuant to this
Intellectual Property Agreement.&nbsp; The parties hereto also agree that it would be impossible or inadequate to
measure and calculate the damages from any breach of the covenants contained in this Intellectual Property Agreement
prior to resolution of any dispute pursuant to arbitration.&nbsp; Accordingly, pursuant to C.C.P. §1281.8(b), if either
party claims that the other party has breached any covenant of this Intellectual Property Agreement, that party will
have available, in addition to any other right or remedy, the right to obtain an injunction from a court of competent
jurisdiction restraining such breach or threatened breach and/or to specific performance of any such provision of this
Agreement pending resolution of the dispute through arbitration.&nbsp; The parties further agree that no bond or other
security shall be required in obtaining such equitable relief and hereby consents to the issuance of such injunction and
to the ordering of specific performance.&nbsp; However, upon appointment of an arbitrator, the arbitrator shall review
any interim, injunctive relief granted by a court of competent jurisdiction and shall have the discretion, jurisdiction,
and authority to continue, expand, or dissolve such relief pending completion of the arbitration of such dispute or
controversy.&nbsp; The parties agree that any orders issued by the arbitrator may be enforced by any court of competent
jurisdiction if necessary to ensure compliance by the parties.
<br>
<br>7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">General Provisions</span>.
<br>
<br>
(a)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;"> Governing Law; Consent to Personal Jurisdiction</span>.&nbsp; This Intellectual Property Agreement will
be governed by the laws of the State of California as they apply to contracts entered into and wholly to be performed
within such State.&nbsp; I hereby expressly consent to the nonexclusive personal jurisdiction and venue of the state and
federal courts located in the federal Northern District of California for any lawsuit filed there by either party
arising from or relating to this Intellectual Property Agreement.
<br>
<br>
(b)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Entire Agreement</span>.&nbsp; This Intellectual Property Agreement sets forth the entire agreement and
understanding between the Company and me relating to the subject matter herein and merges all prior discussions between
us.&nbsp; No modification of or amendment to this Intellectual Property Agreement, nor any waiver of any rights under
this Intellectual Property Agreement, will be effective unless in writing signed by the party to be charged.&nbsp; Any
subsequent change or changes in my duties, salary or compensation will not affect the validity or scope of this
Intellectual Property Agreement.
<br>
<br>
(c)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Severability</span>.&nbsp; If one or more of the provisions in this Intellectual Property Agreement are
deemed void by law, then the remaining provisions will continue in full force and effect.
<br>
<br>
(d)&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Successors and Assigns</span>.&nbsp; This Intellectual Property Agreement will be binding upon my heirs,
executors, administrators and other legal representatives and will be for the benefit of the Company, its successors,
and its assigns.
