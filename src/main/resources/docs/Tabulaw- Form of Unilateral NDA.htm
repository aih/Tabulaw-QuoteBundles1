NON-DISCLOSURE AGREEMENT
</span><br>
<br>
This Non-Disclosure Agreement (this "Agreement") is made and entered into as of ______ __, 200_ by and between Tabulaw,
Inc., a Delaware corporation (the "Company") and ______________________ (the "Second Party").
<br>
<br>
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Purpose</span>.&nbsp; The parties wish to explore a business opportunity and in connection with this
opportunity, the Company may disclose to the Second Party certain confidential technical and business information that
the Company desires the Second Party to treat as confidential.
<br>
<br>
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; "<span style="font-weight: bold;">Confidential Information</span>" means any information disclosed by the Company, either directly or
indirectly, in writing, orally or by inspection of tangible objects, proprietary information, technical data, trade
secrets or know-how (including, without limitation, research, product plans, products, services, customers, markets,
works of original authorship, photographs, negatives, digital images, software, computer programs, know-how, ideas,
inventions (whether or not patentable),&nbsp; processes, formulas, technology, designs, drawings, engineering, hardware
configuration information, marketing or finance documents, customer names, customer list, customer data and other
technical, business, financial, customer and product development plans, forecasts, strategies and information), which is
designated as "Confidential," "Proprietary" or some similar designation. Information communicated orally will be
considered Confidential Information if, when disclosed, such information is (i) characterized as Confidential
Information, (ii) the disclosing party, within a reasonable time after the initial disclosure, so indicates in writing
or orally, or (iii) which the receiving party should have considered to be confidential under the circumstances
surrounding the disclosure.&nbsp; Notwithstanding the foregoing, Confidential Information will not include any
information which (i) was publicly known and made generally available in the public domain prior to the time of
disclosure by the disclosing party; (ii) becomes publicly known and made generally available after disclosure by the
Company to the Second Party through no action or inaction of the Second Party; (iii) is already in the possession of the
Second Party at the time of disclosure as shown by the Second Party's files and records prior to the time of disclosure;
(iv) is obtained by the Second Party from a third party without a breach of such third party?s obligations of
confidentiality; (v) is independently developed by the Second Party without use of or reference to the Company's
Confidential Information, as shown by documents and other competent evidence in the Second Party's possession; or (vi)
is required by law to be disclosed by the Second Party, provided that such party will give the Company written notice of
such requirement prior to disclosing so that the Company may seek a protective order or other appropriate relief.
<br>
<br>
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Non-use and Non-disclosure</span>.&nbsp; Second Party agrees not to use any Confidential Information for
any purpose except to evaluate and engage in discussions concerning a potential business relationship between the
parties.&nbsp; Second Party agrees not to disclose any Confidential Information to third parties, except if it is to a
third party when such is required in order to evaluate or engage in discussions concerning the contemplated business
relationship.&nbsp; Second Party will not reverse engineer, disassemble or decompile any prototypes, software or other
tangible objects which embody the Confidential Information and which are provided hereunder.&nbsp; Second Party agrees
not to export or reexport (within the meaning of U.S. or other export control laws or regulations) any Confidential
Information or product thereof.
<br>
<br>
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Maintenance of Confidentiality</span>.&nbsp; Second Party agrees that it will take reasonable measures to
protect the secrecy of and avoid disclosure and unauthorized use of the Confidential Information.&nbsp; Without limiting
the foregoing, Second Party will take at least those measures that it takes to protect its own most highly confidential
information and will ensure that its employees, if appropriate, who have access to Confidential Information of the
Company have executed a written non-use and non-disclosure agreement in content similar to the provisions hereof, prior
to any disclosure of Confidential Information to such employees.&nbsp; Second Party will not make any copies of the
Confidential Information of the other party unless the Company previously approved it in writing.&nbsp; Second Party
will reproduce the Company's proprietary rights notices on any such approved copies, in the same manner in which such
notices were set forth in or on the original.&nbsp; Recipient shall immediately notify the Company in the event of any
unauthorized use or disclosure of the Confidential Information.
<br>
<br>
5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">No Obligation</span>.&nbsp; Nothing herein will obligate either party to proceed with any transaction
between them, and each party reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to terminate the discussions contemplated by
this Agreement concerning the business opportunity.
<br>
<br>
6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">No Warranty</span>.&nbsp; ALL CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION IS PROVIDED ?AS IS.?&nbsp; THE COMPANY MAKES NO
WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR OTHERWISE, REGARDING ITS ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS OR PERFORMANCE.
<br>
<br>
7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Return of Materials</span>.&nbsp; All documents and other tangible objects containing or representing
Confidential Information, and all copies thereof which are in the possession of the Second Party, will be and remain the
property of the Company and will be promptly returned upon the Company's written request.
<br>
<br>
8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">No License</span>. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to grant any rights to either party under any
patent, copyright, trade secret or other intellectual property right nor will this Agreement grant either party any
rights in or to the other party?s Confidential Information except as expressly set forth herein.
<br>
<br>
9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Term</span>.&nbsp; The obligations of each receiving party hereunder will survive until such time as all
Confidential Information disclosed hereunder becomes publicly known and made generally available through no action or
inaction of the receiving party.
<br>
<br>
10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Remedies</span>. Second Party agrees that its obligations here¬under are necessary and reasonable in
order to protect the Company and the Company's business, and expressly agrees that monetary damages would be inadequate
to compensate the Company for any breach by Second Party of any covenants and agreements set forth herein.&nbsp;
Accordingly, Second Party agrees and acknowledges that any such viola¬tion or threatened violation will cause
irreparable injury to the Company and that, in addition to any other remedies that may be avail¬able, in law, in equity
or otherwise, the Company will be entitled to obtain injunctive relief against the threatened breach of this Agreement
or the continuation of any such breach, without the necessity of proving actual damages.
<br>
<br>
11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Miscellaneous</span>.&nbsp;&nbsp; This Agreement will bind and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto
and the Company's successors and assigns.&nbsp; This Agreement will be governed by the laws of the State of California,
without reference to conflict of laws principles.&nbsp; This document contains the entire agreement between the parties
with respect to the subject matter hereof.&nbsp; Any failure to enforce any provision of this Agreement will not
constitute a waiver thereof or of any other provision.&nbsp; This Agreement may not be amended, nor any obligation
waived, except by a writing signed by both parties hereto.
<br>
<br>
12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Recipient Information</span>.&nbsp; The Company does not wish to receive any confidential information
from Recipient, and the Company assumes no obligation, either express or implied, with respect to any information
disclosed by Recipient.
<br>
<br>
13.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Severability</span>.&nbsp; In the event any term of this Agreement is found by any court to be void or
otherwise unenforceable, the remainder of this agreement will remain valid and enforceable as though such term were
absent upon the date of its execution.
