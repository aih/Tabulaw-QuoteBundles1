</span><br>
<br>
This Mutual Non-Disclosure Agreement (this ?Agreement?) is made and entered into as of __________, 200_ by and between

<br>
<br>
1.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Purpose</span>.&nbsp; The parties wish to explore a business opportunity of mutual interest and in
connection with this opportunity, each party may disclose to the other certain confidential technical and business
information that the disclosing party desires the receiving party to treat as confidential.
<br>
<br>
2.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Confidential Information</span>. shall mean any information disclosed by either party to the other party,
either directly or indirectly, in writing, orally or by inspection of tangible objects, proprietary information,
technical data, trade secrets or know-how (including, without limitation, research, product plans, products, services,
customers, markets, works of original authorship, photographs, negatives, digital images, software, computer programs,
know-how, ideas, inventions (whether or not patentable), processes, formula, technology, designs, drawings, engineering,
hardware configuration information, marketing or finance documents and other technical, business, financial, customer
and product development plans, forecasts, strategies and information), which is designated as ?Confidential,?
?Proprietary? or some similar designation.&nbsp; Information communicated orally will be considered Confidential
Information if, when disclosed, such information is (i) characterized as Confidential Information, (ii) the disclosing
party, within a reasonable time after the initial disclosure, so indicates in writing or orally, or (iii) which the
receiving party should have considered to be confidential under the circumstances surrounding the disclosure.&nbsp;
Confidential Information may also include information disclosed to a disclosing party by third parties.&nbsp;
Notwithstanding the foregoing, Confidential Information shall not include any information which (i) was publicly known
and made generally available in the public domain prior to the time of disclosure by the disclosing party; (ii) becomes
publicly known and made generally available after disclosure by the disclosing party to the receiving party through no
action or inaction of the receiving party; (iii) is already in the possession of the receiving party at the time of
disclosure by the disclosing party as shown by the receiving party?s files and records prior to the time of disclosure;
(iv) is obtained by the receiving party from a third party without a breach of such third party?s obligations of
confidentiality; (v) is independently developed by the receiving party without use of or reference to the disclosing
party?s Confidential Information, as shown by documents and other competent evidence in the receiving party?s
possession; or (vi) is required by law to be disclosed by the receiving party, provided that the receiving party shall
give the disclosing party written notice of such requirement prior to disclosing so that the disclosing party may seek a
protective order or other appropriate relief.
<br>
<br>
3.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Non-use and Non-disclosure</span>.&nbsp; Each party agrees not to use any Confidential Information of the
other party for any purpose except to evaluate and engage in discussions concerning a potential business relationship
between the parties.&nbsp; Each party agrees not to disclose any Confidential Information of the other party to third
parties or to such party?s employees, except to those employees of the receiving party who are required to have the
Confidential Information in order to evaluate or engage in discussions concerning the contemplated business
relationship.&nbsp; Neither party shall reverse engineer, disassemble or decompile any prototypes, software or other
tangible objects which embody the other party?s Confidential Information and which are provided to the party
hereunder.&nbsp; The parties agree not to export or reexport (within the meaning of U.S. or other export control laws or
regulations) any Confidential Information or product thereof.
<br>
<br>
4.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Maintenance of Confidentiality</span>.&nbsp; Each party agrees that it shall take reasonable measures to
protect the secrecy of and avoid disclosure and unauthorized use of the Confidential Information of the other
party.&nbsp; Without limiting the foregoing, each party shall take at least those measures that it takes to protect its
own most highly confidential information and shall ensure that its employees who have access to Confidential Information
of the other party have executed a written non-use and non-disclosure agreement in content similar to the provisions
hereof, prior to any disclosure of Confidential Information to such employees.&nbsp; Neither party shall make any copies
of the Confidential Information of the other party unless the same are previously approved in writing by the other
party.&nbsp; Each party shall reproduce the other party?s proprietary rights notices on any such approved copies, in the
same manner in which such notices were set forth in or on the original.
<br>
<br>
5.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">No Obligation</span>.&nbsp; Nothing herein shall obligate either party to proceed with any transaction
between them, and each party reserves the right, in its sole discretion, to terminate the discussions contemplated by
this Agreement concerning the business opportunity.
<br>
<br>
6.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span style="font-weight: bold;"> No Warranty</span>.&nbsp; ALL CONFIDENTIAL INFORMATION IS PROVIDED ?AS IS?.&nbsp; EACH PARTY MAKES NO
WARRANTIES, EXPRESS, IMPLIED OR OTHERWISE, REGARDING ITS ACCURACY, COMPLETENESS OR PERFORMANCE.
<br>
<br>
7.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Return of Materials</span>.&nbsp; All documents and other tangible objects containing or representing
Confidential Information which have been disclosed by either party to the other party, and all copies thereof which are
in the possession of the other party, shall be and remain the property of the disclosing party and shall be promptly
returned to the disclosing party upon the disclosing party?s written request.
<br>
<br>
8.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">No License</span>. Nothing in this Agreement is intended to grant any rights to either party under any
patent, copyright, trade secret or other intellectual property right nor shall this Agreement grant either party any
rights in or to the other party?s Confidential Information except as expressly set forth herein.
<br>
<br>
9.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Term</span>.&nbsp; The obligations of each receiving party hereunder shall survive until such time as all
Confidential Information of the other party disclosed hereunder becomes publicly known and made generally available
through no action or inaction of the receiving party.
<br>
<br>
10.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Remedies</span>. Each party agrees that its obligations here¬under are necessary and reasonable in order
to protect the other party and the other party?s business, and expressly agrees that monetary damages would be
inadequate to compensate the other party for any breach by either party of any covenants and agreements set forth
herein.&nbsp; Accordingly, each party agrees and acknowledges that any such viola¬tion or threatened violation will
cause irreparable injury to the other party and that, in addition to any other remedies that may be avail¬able, in law,
in equity or otherwise, the other party shall be entitled to obtain injunctive relief against the threatened breach of
this Agreement or the continuation of any such breach, without the necessity of proving actual damages.
<br>
<br>
11.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Miscellaneous</span>.&nbsp; This Agreement shall bind and inure to the benefit of the parties hereto and
their successors and assigns.&nbsp; This Agreement shall be governed by the laws of the State of California, without
reference to conflict of laws principles.&nbsp; This document contains the entire agreement between the parties with
respect to the subject matter hereof, and neither party shall have any obligation, express or implied by law, with
respect to trade secret or proprietary information of the other party except as set forth herein.&nbsp; Any failure to
enforce any provision of this Agreement shall not constitute a waiver thereof or of any other provision.&nbsp; This
Agreement may not be amended, nor any obligation waived, except by a writing signed by both parties hereto.
<br>
<br>
12.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; <span style="font-weight: bold;">Severability</span>.&nbsp; In the event any term of this Agreement is found by any court to be void or
otherwise unenforceable, the remainder of this agreement shall remain valid and enforceable as though such term were
absent upon the date of its execution.
