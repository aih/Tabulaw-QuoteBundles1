      <p>Upon a motion for declaratory judgment filed by the landowners<sup><a href="#[1]" name="r[1]"
        onclick="scife_fn_clicked();">[1]</a></sup> against the Board and another,<sup><a href="#[2]" name="r[2]"
        onclick="scife_fn_clicked();">[2]</a></sup> the trial court declared Article 8A of Chapter 20, Zoning Ordinance of
      James City County, including Sections 12-13 through 12-13-8 incorporated therein (hereafter 8A), facially
      unconstitutional in its entirety. On appeal, the Board asks us to reverse the judgment and enter final judgment
      declaring 8A valid in its entirety, or, in the alternative, to reverse the judgment, sever those portions of 8A
      found unconstitutional, and "provide guidelines" for "constitutionally acceptable" alternatives.</p>
      <p>Landowners are the owners of 24 of 51 parcels of land in a 58-acre tract fronting a distance of about 1.4
      miles on the southern side of U.S. Route 60, which, at this point, is an undivided, five-lane highway. The 58-acre
      tract (hereafter "the subject property") is bounded on the west by the City of Williamsburg and on the east by
      property owned by the Anheuser-Busch Company. The property opposite the subject property fronting on the north
      side of Route 60 is traversed by the main line of the C. &amp; O. Railroad. The property south of the subject
      property is undeveloped land owned by Colonial Williamsburg Foundation. The land north of Route 60 is zoned B-1
      ("general" business). The Anheuser-Busch property is zoned M-1 and M-2 ("limited" and "general" industrial) and
      has been developed in part as an industrial, commercial, and residential complex, and in part as the Busch
      Gardens, a "tourist attraction".</p>
      <p>On January 10, 1973, the Board, by a vote of 3 to 2, enacted 8A in its original form. Under 8A, drafted
      with the technical assistance of Anheuser-Busch personnel, the subject property was rezoned from its B-1
      classification to a new classification termed <a class="gsl_pagenum">204</a> "Business Tourist Entry District,
      B-2". In its final form, 8A requires landowners within the B-2 district to (1) limit use of their property to
      hotels, motels, service stations ("with minor repair and under cover"), gift shops, antique shops, and restaurants
      (other than "fast food" or "drive-in" establishments); (2) build only on lots no less than 150 feet wide (or 120
      feet wide for lots existing on January 10, 1973); (3) "set back" all buildings at least 75 feet from the "back of
      highway curb" on Route 60, or from the "top of the outer slope of the drainage way . . . if no such curb exists";
      (4) dedicate the outer 55 feet of this setback for a service road, including curbs, sidewalks, and landscaped
      median strip; (5) construct that road "in accordance with the applicable standards of the Virginia Department of
      Highways" and maintain the median strip; (6) provide a 10-foot perimeter open space adjoining property lines on
      the sides and rear and a 10-foot perimeter open space adjacent to buildings; (7) landscape and maintain such
      perimeter areas in "good condition"; and (8) submit all preliminary site plans to the "Architectural Design Review
      Board", a five-man body appointed by the Board for two-year terms.</p>
      <p>The landowners filed their motion praying for a declaration that these land use restrictions and
      obligations, as applied to their particular parcels, are unconstitutional. In a decree overruling the Board's
      demurrer, the trial court found that the motion "constitutes a challenge to the validity of Article 8A . . . as a
      whole, and not as it affects any particular plaintiff" and ruled that "the evidence in the trial of this case
      shall be limited to the validity or invalidity of the ordinance as it affects all property owners in a B-2 zone".
      This ruling became and remains the law of the case.</p>
      <p>By final decree entered June 12, 1974, the trial court found</p>
      <blockquote>"that Article 8A . . . in its entirety, including [amendments thereto] . . deprives the
      Complainants and owners in said B-2 zone of property and the reasonable use thereof without due process of law or
      just compensation, discriminates against said property owners, and imposes unreasonable restrictions upon the use
      of the properties within said B-2 zone, contains vague and indefinite language, and includes purposes and
      provisions not authorized by law".</blockquote>
      <p>Upon that finding, the trial court declared that 8A violates "Amendments V and XIV of the Constitution of
      the United States of America and Section 11 of Article I of the Constitution of Virginia" and is "illegal, void,
      and of no effect."</p>
      <p>Some of the questions posited by the numerous assignments of error are interrelated. For the sake of
      convenience and clarity, we will consider them in topical categories.</p>
      <p></p>
      <h2>I. <i>EXHAUSTION OF REMEDIES AND JUSTICIABILITY</i></h2>
      <p></p>
      <p>On appeal, the Board relies on three of its grounds of demurrer, <i>viz.,</i> that the motion failed to
      allege a justiciable controversy; that the motion failed to allege an inadequate remedy at law;<sup><a
        href="#[3]" name="r[3]" onclick="scife_fn_clicked();">[3]</a></sup> and that the motion failed to allege an exhaustion
      of administrative remedies.</p>
      <p>Under Code Â§ 8-578 (Repl.Vol.1957), an action for declaratory judgment shall not "be open to objection on
      the ground that a judgment or order merely declaratory of right is prayed for", and "[c]ontroversies involving the
      interpretation of . . . statutes, municipal ordinances and other governmental regulations, may be so determined",
      provided there is an "actual antagonistic assertion and denial of right." To invoke the jurisdiction of the court,
      "[t]he controversy must be one that is justiciable, that is, where specific adverse claims, based upon present
      rather than future or speculative <a class="gsl_pagenum">205</a> facts, are ripe for judicial adjustment." <a
        href="/scholar_case?case=13968170780861734556&amp;q=allintitle:+rowe&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2002"><i>City
      of Fairfax</i> v. <i>Shanklin,</i> 205 Va. 227, 229, 135 S.E.2d 773, 775 (1964)</a>.</p>
      <p>The "legality of an ordinance is tested not only by what has been done under its provisions but what may be
      done thereunder." <a
        href="/scholar_case?case=2546510638436572385&amp;q=allintitle:+rowe&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2002"><i>City
      of Winchester</i> v. <i>Glover,</i> 199 Va. 70, 72, 97 S.E.2d 661, 663 (1957)</a>. When, as here, a property owner alleges
      that a zoning ordinance creates discriminatory, arbitrary, and capricious classifications bearing no substantial
      relation to the public health, safety, or welfare, or that a zoning ordinance imposes land use restrictions or
      affirmative land use obligations so unreasonable as to constitute a "taking" of property without compensation or
      due process of law, or that a zoning ordinance is otherwise unconstitutional, and that he has suffered damage to
      his property located in a district affected by such ordinance, he has stated a case of actual controversy within
      the meaning of Code Â§ 8-578 and one that is "ripe for judicial adjustment."</p>
      <blockquote>"If the ordinance is unreasonable and unconstitutional in its entirety and the result of
      such unreasonableness is to confiscate plaintiff's property or to discriminate against it, then an action for a
      declaratory judgment lies." 2 A. Rathkopf, <i>The Law of Zoning and Planning</i> 35-5 (1972).</blockquote>
      <p>The Board argues, however, that even when the constitutionality of a legislative act is challenged, "a
      court of equity does not have jurisdiction unless the complainant lacks an adequate remedy at law" and "the courts
      will not take jurisdiction of a zoning matter, even though a constitutional issue is raised, until the
      administrative remedy has been fully exhausted."</p>
      <p>A landowner aggrieved by a zoning classification has a right to apply to the zoning administrator for a
      variance, a right to appeal to the County Board of Zoning Appeals, and a right to obtain judicial review of that
      board's decision. Code Â§Â§ 15.1-495, -497 (Repl.Vol.1973, Cum.Supp. 1974); Article 13, James City County Zoning
      Ordinance. <i>See also, </i><a
        href="/scholar_case?case=3076236478192206853&amp;q=allintitle:+rowe&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2002"><i>Lake
      George Corporation</i> v. <i>Standing,</i> 211 Va. 733, 180 S.E.2d 522 (1971)</a>. However, when the relief sought
      constitutes a challenge to the constitutionality of a zoning ordinance in its entirety,<sup><a href="#[4]"
        name="r[4]" onclick="scife_fn_clicked();">[4]</a></sup> only a variance providing total exemption would vindicate the
      rights asserted. But, under Code Â§ 15.1-495, "all variances shall be in harmony with the intended spirit and
      purpose of the ordinance" in order "that the character of the district will not be changed". A variance releasing
      landowners from all the restrictions and obligations complained of here would be contrary to the intended "spirit
      and purpose" of 8A, and therefore would be beyond the purport of Code Â§Â§ 15.1-495, -497.</p>
      <p>Since there was no administrative remedy equal to the relief sought (and thus no adequate legal remedy by
      judicial review), we hold that the motion properly stated a justiciable cause of action and the trial court
      correctly overruled the demurrer.</p>
      <p></p>
      <h2>* * * * * *</h2>
      <p></p>
      <p>We consider next the three broad constitutional issues raised by the Board's assignments of error, <i>viz.,</i>
      whether the B-2 zoning of the subject property to the exclusion of other areas is a discriminatory classification
      in violation of the equal protection guarantee; whether the land use obligations imposed by 8A violate the due
      process guarantee; <a class="gsl_pagenum">206</a> and whether the land use restrictions imposed by 8A violate the
      due process or equal protection guarantees.</p>
      <p></p>
      <h2>II. <i>DISTRICT CLASSIFICATIONS AND EQUAL PROTECTION</i></h2>
      <p></p>
      <p>"The governing body of any county . . may, by ordinance, divide the territory under its jurisdiction or any
      substantial portion thereof into districts of such number, shape and area as it may deem best suited to carry out
      the purposes of this article. . .", Code Â§ 15.1-486 (Repl.Vol.1973), and ". . . the regulations in one district
      may differ from those in other districts." Code Â§ 15.1-488 (Repl.Vol.1973). Encompassing the specific purposes of
      zoning ordinances defined in Code Â§ 15.1-489 (Repl.Vol.1973) is "the general purpose of promoting the health,
      safety or general welfare of the public. . . ." By these and related statutes, the General Assembly has delegated
      to local governments the police power to establish and regulate zoning districts.</p>
      <p>Boundary lines of zoning districts must be struck somewhere, and a line drawn by the most impartial arbiter
      is, to some unavoidable degree, arbitrary.</p>
      <blockquote>"It is seldom that there is any definite reason for holding that a lot on one side of a
      line should be devoted to one purpose and that just across it to another. The adaptability of certain territorial
      sections of cities to certain uses fade into each other. One end of a field may be, beyond peradventure, suited to
      industrial developments, the other to private homes. Intervening there must be a twilight zone. If the Legislature
      cannot be relied upon to say where lines must run, who can be vested with that discretion? Demonstrative accuracy
      is an impossibility." <i>West Bros. Brick Co.</i> v. <i>City of Alexandria,</i> 169 Va. 271, 283-84, 192 S.E. 881,
      886 (1937), <i>app. dism'd,</i> 302 U.S. 658, 58 S.Ct. 369, 82 L.Ed. 508 (1937), <i>reh. denied,</i> 302 U.S. 781,
      58 S.Ct. 480, 82 L.Ed. 603 (1938).</blockquote>
      <p>The landowners contend that a B-2 classification for the subject property is discriminatory because the
      adjacent property of Anheuser-Busch is classified M-1 and M-2. Adjacency is always relevant to the question of
      discriminatory zoning classification, but adjacent properties may be zoned differently when there is a rational
      basis for the different classifications. 8 E. McQuillin, <i>Municipal Corporations</i> Â§ 25.61(152-53) (1965); 1
      Rathkopf, <i>supra</i> at 7-2 to 7-4; 1 Yokley, <i>supra</i> at Â§ 4-17(164). <i>See also, </i><a
        href="/scholar_case?case=5962600535882983689&amp;q=allintitle:+rowe&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2002"><i>Lewis</i>
      v. <i>District of Columbia,</i> 89 U.S. App.D.C. 72, 190 F.2d 25, 28 (1951)</a>. Zoning classifications of adjoining
      areas enjoy the presumption of legislative validity and equal protection until the presumption is overcome by
      evidence of discrimination. <a
        href="/scholar_case?case=16018036845936545349&amp;q=allintitle:+rowe&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2002"><i>Board
      of Supervisors</i> v. <i>Carper,</i> 200 Va. 653, 107 S.E.2d 390 (1959)</a>; <i>Fairfax County</i> v. <i>Parker,</i> 186
      Va. 675, 44 S.E.2d 9 (1947). Here, as far as the landowners' evidence shows, the only indicium of similarity
      between the subject property and the Anheuser-Busch property is physical adjacency, and the presumption of
      validity of the different classifications must prevail.</p>
      <p>Conceding that "[t]he fact that only one area of the County is included within the B-2 zone would not of
      itself prove discrimination", the landowners argue that "[t]he fact that other areas of the County meet the same
      criteria or definition as a `tourist entry zone' but have not been burdened with the confiscatory restriction,
      does."</p>
      <p>Under 8A, the B-2 classification "is not intended for general application in all parts of the County but
      will be limited to those areas where high traffic volume tourist corridors exist." The record contains some
      evidence that the roads bearing the heaviest tourist entry into the Williamsburg area are those which approach
      from the north and west, and none of the property along those several roads has been zoned B-2. However, the
      traffic entering the area on one of those roads is only a portion of the traffic travelling both east and west
      along Route 60 between Williamsburg and Busch <a class="gsl_pagenum">207</a> Gardens. How the latter traffic load
      compares with traffic between the Williamsburg area and other major tourist attractions, such as Jamestown and
      Yorktown, is not disclosed by the evidence. Nor is there any evidence to show that, in respects other than traffic
      impact, the subject property is similar to other property situated between two historical attractions.</p>
      <p>Absent such evidence, and in light of testimony that the subject property is "a very special piece of
      property" and is "unlike any other property in the County", the landowners failed to show that zoning of the
      subject property to a classification different from that assigned other areas of the county is discriminatory.</p>
      <p></p>
      <h2>III. <i>LAND USE OBLIGATIONS AND DUE PROCESS</i></h2>
      <p></p>
      <p>Aside from restrictions on use, 8A imposes certain affirmative obligations as conditions to the right to
      develop.</p>
      <p></p>
      <h2>A. <i>DEDICATION</i></h2>
      <p></p>
      <p>B-2 landowners are required to dedicate to the county a parcel of land 55 feet wide fronting upon the south
      side of Route 60. This parcel will accommodate a sidewalk adjacent to the curb 5 feet wide, a median strip 15 feet
      wide, a curb 2.5 feet wide, a service road 24 feet wide, another curb 2.5 feet wide, and another sidewalk 6 feet
      wide. Based upon property values prior to the enactment of 8A, the value of the property required to be dedicated
      was in excess of $850,000.</p>
      <p>By express statutory authorization, a landowner in Virginia may be involuntarily divested of his fee under
      certain defined circumstances. His land may be sold to satisfy a tax lien of the sovereign. Code Â§Â§ 58-1117.1, <i>et
      seq.</i> (Repl.Vol.1974). His land may be sold to satisfy the claim of a judgment lien creditor. Code Â§Â§ 8-655 <i>et
      seq.</i> (Repl.Vol.1957). His land may be taken by the sovereign for public purposes by eminent domain. Code Â§Â§
      25-46.1 <i>et seq.</i> (Repl.Vol.1973, Cum.Supp.1974). In every case of involuntary taking thus authorized by
      statute, there is a <i>quid pro quo</i> for the loss of the fee.</p>
      <p>In some jurisdictions, the courts have held that the zoning enabling statutes authorize local zoning bodies
      to require subdividers to dedicate portions of their property for public purposes (or pay an assessment in lieu of
      such dedication) as a condition precedent to development.<sup><a href="#[5]" name="r[5]"

      <p>In determining the constitutional scope of the zoning police power delegated to local governments in
      Virginia, we look first to our own enabling statutes. Code Â§ 15.1-465 (Repl.Vol.1973) authorizes local governments
      to "adopt an ordinance to assure the orderly subdivision of land and its development" and defines "subdivision" to
      mean "the division of a parcel of land into three or more lots or parcels of less than five acres each for the
      purpose of transfer of ownership or building development". Under Code Â§ 15.1-466(f) (Repl.Vol.1973), such
      ordinance may include provisions "[f]or the acceptance of dedication for public use of any right-of-way located
      within any subdivision which has constructed therein, or proposed to be constructed therein, any street, curb,
      gutter, sidewalk, drainage or sewerage system or other improvement. . .." Under Code Â§ 15.1-478 (Cum. Supp.1974),
      recordation of a subdivision plat operates "to transfer, in fee simple," to the local government "such portion of
      the premises platted as is on such plat set apart from streets, alleys, or other public use and to transfer . . .
      any easement indicated on such plat to create a public right of passage . . .."</p>
      <p>Clearly, the enabling statutes authorize local zoning ordinances which permit local governing bodies to <i>accept</i>
      dedications by <i>subdividers</i> for certain public facilities. Arguably, the language of the statutes would
      support an inference that local governing bodies, in the exercise of their authority to grant or withhold
      subdivision approval, are empowered to require an offer and acceptance of dedications for access roads and other
      public facilities as the price of property development. Indeed, on brief, the landowners "recognize the right of
      local governments to require adequate public access to lots subdivided and sold to the public." But that question,
      with its constitutional implications, is not before us and we do not decide it.</p>
      <p>We are not concerned with the creation of a subdivision but with development of individually-owned parcels
      of land. The precise question before us is whether a local governing body has the power to enact a zoning
      ordinance that requires individual landowners, as a condition to the right to develop their parcels, to dedicate a
      portion of their fee for the purpose of providing a road, the need for which is substantially generated by public
      traffic demands rather than by the proposed development.<sup><a href="#[6]" name="r[6]"
        onclick="scife_fn_clicked();">[6]</a></sup> Our enabling statutes delegate no such power.<sup><a href="#[7]"
        name="r[7]" onclick="scife_fn_clicked();">[7]</a></sup> Moreover, Article I, Â§ 11, of the Constitution of Virginia
      expressly and unequivocally provides "that the General Assembly shall not pass any law . . . whereby private
      property shall be taken or damaged for <a class="gsl_pagenum">209</a> public uses, without just compensation."<sup><a
        href="#[8]" name="r[8]" onclick="scife_fn_clicked();">[8]</a></sup> The dedication requirement of 8A offends that
      constitutional guarantee, and we hold that it is invalid.</p>
      <p></p>
      <h2>B. <i>CONSTRUCTION AND MAINTENANCE</i></h2>
      <p></p>
      <p>B-2 landowners are also required to construct the service road, curbs, and sidewalk at a cost of $37.13 per
      lineal foot (or $268,439.00 for the entirety) and to landscape and maintain the median strip on the land dedicated
      to the county. Although 8A does not speak to the question, we assume, as did witnesses for the Board, that once
      the road is constructed, it is to be maintained by the state.</p>
      <p>As the Board says, the police power is "elastic". But its stretch is not infinite. If it were, no property
      right, indeed, no personal right, could co-exist with it.</p>
      <blockquote>"The protection of private property in the Fifth Amendment presupposes that it is wanted
      for public use, but provides that it shall not be taken for such use without compensation. A similar assumption is
      made in the decisions upon the Fourteenth Amendment. [Citation omitted]. When this seemingly absolute protection
      is found to be qualified by the police power, the natural tendency of human nature is to extend the qualification
      more and more until at last private property disappears. But that cannot be accomplished in this way under the
      Constitution of the United States.</blockquote>
      <blockquote>". . . We are in danger of forgetting that a strong public desire to improve the public
      condition is not enough to warrant achieving the desire by a shorter cut than the constitutional way of paying for
      the change." <a href="/scholar_case?case=15307284477438038942&amp;q=allintitle:+rowe&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2002"><i>Pennsylvania
      Coal Co.</i> v. <i>Mahon,</i> 260 U.S. 393, 415-16, 43 S.Ct. 158, 160, 67 L.Ed. 322 (1922)</a>.</blockquote>
      <p>The Board cites nothing in the constitution, enabling statutes, or case law of Virginia which empowers the
      sovereign to require private landowners, as a condition precedent to development, to construct or maintain public
      facilities on land owned by the sovereign, when the need for such facilities is not substantially generated by the
      proposed development.<sup><a href="#[9]" name="r[9]" onclick="scife_fn_clicked();">[9]</a></sup> The private money
      necessary to fund the performance of such requirements is "property", and we hold that such requirements violate
      the constitutional guarantee that "no person shall be deprived of his life, liberty, or property without due
      process of law . . . ." Constitution of Virginia, Art. I, Â§ 11.</p>
      <p></p>
      <h2>IV. <i>LAND USE RESTRICTIONSâ€” EQUAL PROTECTION AND DUE PROCESS</i></h2>
      <p></p>
      <p>In the nomenclature of zoning, "use restriction" is understood to mean a restriction on the type of use to
      which land may be put. The land use restrictions which we treat in this Part include both qualitative <a
        class="gsl_pagenum">210</a> and quantitative restrictions on the right to use land.</p>
      <p>When a land use permitted to one landowner is restricted to another similarly situated, the restriction is
      discriminatory, and, if not substantially related to the public health, safety, or welfare, constitutes a denial
      of equal protection of the laws. A restriction on the right to use which thus denies equal protection also
      constitutes a "taking" of one of the most valuable components of the package of private property rights, and,
      absent just compensation, such taking is a denial of due process of law.</p>
      <p></p>
      <h2>A. <i>RESTRICTIONS OF BUILDABLE AREA</i></h2>
      <p></p>
      <p>The "buildable area", <i>i. e.,</i> the acreage on which buildings in a B-2 zone may be constructed, is
      restricted by 8A to what remains after compliance with the 75-foot setback line on the front, the requirement of a
      10-foot perimeter open space adjoining the property lines on the sides and rear, and the requirement of a 10-foot
      perimeter open space adjacent to buildings. The perimeters of open-space areas must be increased (and the
      buildable area decreased) by one foot for each foot of building height in excess of 35 feet, and no part of such
      open spaces may be used for automobile parking. The size of the buildable area is also affected by the restriction
      that no building may be constructed on lots less than 150 feet wide (or 120 feet wide for lots existing on January
      10, 1973).</p>
      <p>Code Â§ 15.1-486 authorizes local governing bodies to adopt ordinances to "regulate, restrict, permit,
      prohibit, and determine. . . [t]he areas and dimensions of land, water, and air space to be occupied by buildings,
      structures and uses, and of courts, yards, and other open spaces to be left unoccupied by uses and structures. . .
      ."</p>
      <p>Standing alone, this language is broad enough to authorize the use of the police power to impose reasonable
      restrictions on buildable area. Repeatedly, we have recognized the authority of local governments to adopt setback
      line restrictions. <a

      603, 47 S.Ct. 675, 71 L.Ed. 1228 (1926)</a>. The power to prescribe reasonable minimum lot width restrictions and open
      space requirements is clearly within the ambit of Code Â§ 15.1-486, and, by necessary implication from the
      authority to "regulate", so is the power to require that open spaces on privately-owned land be landscaped and
      maintained in good condition.</p>
      <p>Here, each of these requirements and restrictions on buildable area enjoys the presumption of legislative
      reasonableness, and the burden of rebutting the presumption, by evidence of the unreasonableness of each, rested
      upon the landowners. Considering each in isolation from the others, we believe that the landowners failed to
      overcome that presumption.</p>
      <p>However, while local governments have been given the power to enact ordinances imposing such building
      restrictions and open space requirements, "such ordinances to be valid must be to promote public health, safety,
      prosperity, morals and public welfare. The mere power to enact an ordinance . . . does not carry with it the right
      arbitrarily or capriciously to deprive a person of the legitimate use of his property." <a
        href="/scholar_case?case=16018036845936545349&amp;q=allintitle:+rowe&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2002"><i>Board
      of Supervisors</i> v. <i>Carper, supra,</i> 200 Va. at 662, 107 S.E.2d at 396</a>.</p>
      <p>With the <i>Carper</i> rule in mind, we must consider these building restrictions and requirements and
      examine their cumulative effect.</p>
      <p>The landowners' evidence shows that the setback restriction and the open-space requirements would prohibit
      construction of buildings upon a total of 16.78 acres, or about 29% of the 58 acres classified B-2. Based upon
      market values prior to the enactment of 8A, the value of the 16.78 acres was $1,959,167.35.</p>
      <p><a class="gsl_pagenum">211</a> These acreage and valuation computations make no allowance for any
      restriction of buildable area that may result from surpassing the building height limitation or from reservation
      of acreage for parking needs. Parking on the service road and open spaces is forbidden. If businesses are to serve
      customers, landowners must provide space for parking in some area not reserved for open spaces. That area must be
      at least as wide as twice the length of an automobile to enable it to maneuver into and out of parking position.</p>
      <p>The landowners introduced an expert witness whose testimony, illustrated by exhibits, showed that the
      buildable area restrictions as a whole rendered 17 of the 51 B-2 lots undevelopable. Disputing this evidence, the
      Board says that 8 of the 17 lots are developable because two or more adjacent lots are held in common ownership.
      Since the restrictions are addressed to individual lots, individually assessed and taxed, and since an owner of
      several lots (any of which he has the right to sell) cannot be deprived of the <i>beneficial</i> use of any
      individual lot, we fail to see how common ownership is constitutionally significant. The Board also argues that,
      while some of the individually-owned lots are too small for B-2 development, they are large enough to accommodate
      some productive development under a variance. As we noted in Part I, <i>supra,</i> however, if development
      requires a variance so broad that it violates the "spirit and purpose" of 8A, an application for a variance would
      be futile.<sup><a href="#[10]" name="r[10]" onclick="scife_fn_clicked();">[10]</a></sup></p>
      <p>On cross-examination, the Board's witness, the real estate assessor and financial director of the City of
      Williamsburg, testified that "[s]ales have stopped after the B-2 zone went into effect." The landowners' witness,
      a real estate broker, testified that, based upon prior sales of similar property, the market value of the subject
      property prior to adoption of 8A had been $2.69 per square foot and thereafter had declined to $1.50 per square
      foot, while the values of neighboring properties had remained constant.</p>
      <p>Although, as we have said, we are of opinion that the landowners' evidence was insufficient to overcome the
      legislative presumption of reasonableness as it pertains to these buildable area restrictions <i>individually,</i>
      we hold that their evidence was sufficient to show that, <i>collectively,</i> those restrictions are unreasonable
      and bear no substantial relationship to the public health, safety, or welfare; that such evidence overcame the
      presumption of legislative validity; that the Board's evidence of reasonableness was insufficient to make the
      question fairly debatable; and that the cumulative effect of the restrictions upon buildable area was such as "to
      deprive a person of the legitimate use of his property" in violation of the rule in <i>Carper.</i></p>
      <p></p>
      <h2>B. <i>COMMERCIAL USE RESTRICTIONS</i></h2>
      <p></p>
      <p>After dividing its jurisdiction into districts, a local governing body may, within each district,
      "regulate, restrict, permit, prohibit, and determine . . . [t]he use of land, buildings, structures and other
      premises for agricultural, commercial, industrial, residential, flood plain and other specific uses". Code Â§
      15.1-486.</p>
      <p>Here, the Board divided its jurisdiction into districts and placed each in a broad category. Two of these
      categories are reserved for business uses, and the subject property has been assigned to one of these. We have
      rejected a constitutional challenge to this classification structure (<i>see</i> Part II, <i>supra</i>). We now
      consider whether the subclassifications the Board made within the category to which the subject property is
      assigned violate constitutional restraints.</p>
      <p>Within the B-2 business classification, 8A separates commercial uses into two distinct sub-classes. Hotels,
      motels, and theatres <a class="gsl_pagenum">212</a> are permitted; banks, office buildings, and grocery stores are
      prohibited. "Antique shops" are permitted; shops selling antique reproductions are prohibited. "Restaurants" are
      permitted; "fast food" or "drivein" restaurants are prohibited. Gift shops are permitted, provided they are
      "accessory to hotels or motels having 50 or more dwelling or lodging units" and are "designed and scaled only to
      meet the requirements of occupants and their guests"; other retail stores selling identical gifts are prohibited.</p>
      <p>Like classifications of districts into broad use categories, sub-classifications of uses permitted and uses
      prohibited are, to some degree, arbitrary. Such sub-classifications are presumed to be reasonable, but, unless
      they are substantially related to the public health, safety, or welfare, the restrictions on use offend both the
      equal protection and due process guarantees.</p>
      <blockquote>"[A] classification cannot prohibit or restrict certain uses and permit other uses where
      there is no valid basis, reasonably related to the public health, safety, morals, welfare or other proper object
      of the police power, for distinguishing between them." 8 McQuillin, <i>supra</i> at Â§ 25.123(332).</blockquote>
      <p><i>See e. g., </i><a
        href="/scholar_case?case=657336803024582481&amp;q=allintitle:+rowe&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2002"><i>Frost</i>
      v. <i>Village of Glen Ellyn,</i> 30 Ill.2d 241, 195 N.E.2d 616 (1964)</a> (holding exclusion of drive-in restaurant
      from a business zone unreasonable, arbitrary, and capricious); <i>Vernon Park Realty</i> v. <i>Mount Vernon,</i>
      307 N.Y. 493, 121 N.E.2d 517 (1954) (striking down an ordinance which excluded all uses except vehicular parking).</p>
      <p>One of the permissible purposes of a zoning ordinance is "to protect against destruction of or encroachment
      upon historic areas". Code Â§ 15.1-489. Nothing in the evidence shows that implementation of any of the commercial
      uses prohibited by 8A would destroy or encroach upon Colonial Williamsburg. Nor is there any evidence that such
      uses are noxious, dangerous, or otherwise inimical to the public health, safety, or welfare. The exclusion from a
      zoning district of a particular use, or category of uses, will be upheld where that exclusion is substantially
      related to a proper exercise of the police power. <i>Fairfax County</i> v. <i>Parker, supra,</i> 186 Va. at 688,
      44 S.E.2d at 15 (upholding a use restriction against a commercial junkyard within a residential district). But 8A
      excludes a large number of otherwise legitimate retail business uses from a retail business district, when nothing
      in the record shows that the uses excluded would be more detrimental to the public welfare than the uses
      permitted.</p>
      <p>The trial court ruled that 8A "imposes unreasonable restrictions upon the use of properties within said B-2
      zone". Finding no substantial nexus between the commercial use restrictions imposed and the public weal, we are of
      opinion that the ruling of the trial court was correct; that the evidence was sufficient to overcome the
      legislative presumption of reasonableness; that the Board's evidence was insufficient to make the question of
      reasonableness fairly debatable; and that the commercial use restrictions deny B-2 landowners equal protection of
      the laws and constitute a "taking" of property without due process of law.</p>
      <p></p>
      <h2>C. <i>ARCHITECTURAL DESIGN RESTRICTIONS</i></h2>
      <p></p>
      <p>Under 8A, approval of preliminary site plans is made "conditional, subject to Architectural Design Review
      procedures as set forth under General Provisions, Article 12, Section 12-13." That article requires the applicant
      to submit "schematic architectural plans indicating accurate elevations of each facade, and sufficient detailing
      to indicate materials, colors, texture, light reflecting characteristics, and special features intended for the
      building." In deciding whether the proposed building is "acceptable", the five-man Architectural Design Review
      Board is to be "governed solely by the purposes of architectural design review". These purposes are:</p>
      <blockquote>". . . to protect property values and to promote the general welfare by insuring <a
        class="gsl_pagenum">213</a> buildings in good taste, proper proportion, in general and reasonable harmony with
      the existing buildings in the surrounding area, and to encourage architecture which shall be distinct from the
      Colonial Williamsburg architecture."</blockquote>
      <p>Landowners assert that nothing in the enabling statutes delegates authority to local government to impose
      restrictions on architectural design. The Board relies upon Code Â§ 15.1-489 which provides that "ordinances shall
      be designed . . . to facilitate the creation of a convenient, attractive and harmonious community . . ."</p>
      <p>A community in which all buildings are required to conform to a particular design, or one in which a
      particular design is forbidden to all buildings, may be "convenient, attractive and harmonious". However, a
      "county cannot limit or restrict the use which a person may make of his property under the guise of its police
      power where the exercise of such power would be justified solely on aesthetic considerations." <a
        href="/scholar_case?case=15606353007344201930&amp;q=allintitle:+rowe&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2002"><i>Kenyon
      Peck</i> v. <i>Kennedy,</i> 210 Va. 60, 64, 168 S.E.2d 117, 120-21 (1969)</a>. While the fact that aesthetic
      considerations entered into the reasons for the passage of an ordinance will not invalidate it, it is valid only
      "if other elements within the scope of police power are present." <i>Id.</i></p>
      <p>The Board argues that "the preservation of the commercial value of an area as a tourist attraction is
      within the police power of the local government". It is true that Code Â§ 15.1-503.2(a) (Cum.Supp.1974) authorizes
      certain counties, including James City County to "adopt an ordinance setting forth the historic landmarks within
      the county" and to create "one or more historic districts adjacent to such landmarks" in which "no building . . .
      shall be erected . . . unless the same is approved by the board of supervisors of such county as being
      architecturally compatible with the historic landmark. . . ." However, for two reasons this statute does not give
      the Board the police power it claims. First, the statute expressly provides that "[n]o such historic district
      shall extend further than one-quarter mile from the property line of the land pertaining to any such historic
      landmark", and, as the parties stipulated, the Board has never adopted any ordinance designating any historical
      landmark within one-quarter mile of the B-2 zone. Second, the only architectural design power delegated to the
      county is the power to require architectural design "compatible with the historic landmark"; here, the requirement
      is that architectural design be "distinct from" the landmark.</p>
      <p>Some jurisdictions have adopted the rule upholding architectural design regulations when it appears that
      the purpose of the ordinance was to protect property values within the zone. <a
        href="/scholar_case?case=11520801957319555838&amp;q=allintitle:+rowe&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2002"><i>State</i>
      v. <i>Berkeley,</i> 458 S.W.2d 305 (Mo.1970)</a>; <a

      v. <i>Architectural Board of Review,</i> 119 Ohio App. 67, 192 N.E.2d 74 (1963)</a>; <i>Saveland Park Holding

      L.Ed. 750 (1955). We decline to follow this rule when, as here, it appears that the predominant purpose of the
      ordinance was to promote aesthetic values and the purpose recited in the ordinance to protect property values was
      merely an incidental goal.</p>
      <p>Finding nothing in the enabling statutes which delegates to the Board the power it claims, we hold that the
      Board was without authority to impose the architectural design restrictions incorporated in 8A and that, as the
      trial court ruled, 8A "includes purposes and provisions not authorized by law". In light of our holding, it is
      unnecessary to consider whether the standards governing the exercise of the legislative power delegated by the
      Board to the Architectural Design Review Board were unconstitutionally vague.</p>
      <p></p>
      <h2>V. <i>EVIDENTIARY ISSUES</i></h2>
      <p></p>
      <p>The Board says that the trial court committed error in admitting evidence "regarding <a class="gsl_pagenum">214</a>
      the effect of the zoning ordinance upon specific, individual parcels of land within the B-2 zone"; testimony
      "regarding property values on Route 60 West outside the B-2 District"; and exhibits used by the landowners' expert
      witness to illustrate his testimony.</p>
      <p>The Board also contends that the trial court erred in refusing to permit its witness to testify concerning
      a third-party study of present and projected traffic conditions and in refusing to permit another witness "to
      clarify, qualify, explain, rebut and impeach" the testimony of the landowners' witness concerning the value of
      certain lots in the B-2 zone.</p>
      <p>The trial judge sat without a jury. Nothing in the record indicates that his final judgment order was based
      on inadmissible testimony or that any evidence proffered and excluded was essential to a fair determination of the
      dispositive issues before him. We are of opinion that none of his evidentiary rulings constituted reversible
      error.</p>
      <p></p>
      <h2>VI. <i>SEVERABILITY</i></h2>
      <p></p>
      <p>Relying upon the severability clause contained in Article 16 of the James City County Zoning Ordinance, the
      Board asks us to sever those portions of 8A which we have found unconstitutional in order to preserve what
      remains.<sup><a href="#[11]" name="r[11]" onclick="scife_fn_clicked();">[11]</a></sup></p>
      <p>Paraphrasing the Supreme Court's language in <a
        href="/scholar_case?case=6690667556596791816&amp;q=allintitle:+rowe&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2002"><i>Carter</i>
      v. <i>Carter Coal Co.,</i> 298 U.S. 238, 312-13, 56 S.Ct. 855, 80 L.Ed. 1160 (1936),</a> quoted with approval in <i>Hannabass</i>
      v. <i>Maryland Cas. Co.,</i> 169 Va. 559, 571, 194 S.E. 808, 813 (1938), we posit the rules concerning
      severability. Absent a severability provision, a legislative act is presumed to be non-severable, and the burden
      of proving severability is upon the supporter of the legislation. Where a severability provision is included, a
      legislative act is presumed to be severable, the burden of proving non-severability is on the assailant of the
      legislation, and the presumption of severability must be overcome by considerations which establish the clear
      probability that the legislature would not have been satisfied with what remains after elimination of the invalid
      parts. Whether there is or is not a severability provision, "the determination, in the end, is reached by applying
      the same testâ€”namely, What was the intent of the lawmakers?" 169 Va. at 571, 194 S.E. at 813. While the presence
      of a severability provision "provides a rule of construction which may sometimes aid in determining [legislative]
      intent . . . it is an aid merely; not an inexorable command." <a
        href="/scholar_case?case=3387758568679278396&amp;q=allintitle:+rowe&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2002"><i>Dorchy</i>
      v. <i>Kansas,</i> 264 U.S. 286, 290, 44 S.Ct. 323, 325, 68 L.Ed. 686 (1924)</a>.</p>
      <p>Here, the Board enjoys the presumption of severability. To determine whether that presumption has been
      overcome, we must look to see what parts of 8A remain after the parts we have found invalid are eliminated.</p>
      <p>The parts we have found invalid include: the dedication requirement; the requirement of construction of the
      service road, curbs, and sidewalk; the requirement of landscaping and maintenance of the median <a
        class="gsl_pagenum">215</a> strip on the dedicated land; the restrictions on buildable area, collectively
      applied; the restrictions on commercial use; and the architectural design review procedures.</p>
      <p>The parts that remain include: one or more of the restrictions on buildable area, including the setback
      line restriction, the open space requirements, the minimum width lot requirement, the building height provisions,
      and the parking regulations, provided the effect of the collective application of more than one such restriction,
      provision, or regulation is not so great as "to deprive a person of the legitimate use of his property"; the
      requirement of landscaping and maintenance of open spaces on privately-owned property; the special regulations for
      underground utilities and above-ground utility facilities; the outdoor sign regulations; the site plan review
      requirement; and the variance and waiver clauses.</p>
      <p>We hold that the presumption of severability has been overcome. The parts eliminated are crucial to the
      purpose and spirit of the ordinance. Indeed, they are the vital organs of the legislative creature. The remaining
      parts are mere appendages, and, when severed, are wholly without significant function. We confidently believe that
      the Board of Supervisors of James City County would not have enacted an ordinance containing only what now remains
      of 8A. Under the rules cited above, we hold that the trial court did not err in striking down 8A in its entirety.</p>
      <p></p>
      <h2>* * * * * *</h2>
      <p></p>
      <p>We have found no reversible error, and the final decree entered June 12, 1974, is affirmed.</p>
      <p>However, since the enactment of 8A repealed the B-1 classification of the subject property and the effect
      of the final decree was to leave the land unzoned, the cause must be remanded to the trial court under instruction
      to enter another decree. The new decree will suspend the effective date of the June 12, 1974, decree for a
      prescribed period of time and direct the Board to consider further legislative action. The new decree will enjoin
      the Board during that period from taking any action inconsistent with this opinion. The new decree will further
      provide that, if the Board fails to comply within the prescribed period, the June 12, 1974, decree will become
      effective and the injunction will become permanent.</p>
      <p>Affirmed and remanded.</p>

      <p><a href="#r[4]" name="[4]" onclick="scife_fn_clicked();">[4]</a> A claim that a zoning ordinance is invalid
      in its entirety is one which alleges that "the ordinance is unreasonable in itself without regard to any
      particular property . . ."; where the claim is that the ordinance is invalid as applied, the alleged invalidity
      stems from factors "peculiar to the property involved." 2 Rathkopf, <i>supra</i> at 35-7 to 35-10. A landowner
      challenging the validity of a zoning ordinance as applied to his property need not apply for a variance before
      bringing his declaratory judgment action if the challenged restrictions or obligations could not be remedied by
      variance. 3 R. Anderson, <i>American Law of Zoning</i> Â§ 24.06(670) (1968); 2 Rathkopf, <i>supra</i> at 35-6; 2 E.
      Yokley, <i>Zoning Law and Practice</i> Â§ 18-11(405) (1965, Cum.Supp.1974).</p>
      <p><a href="#r[5]" name="[5]" onclick="scife_fn_clicked();">[5]</a> The rationale for that rule is that the
      legislative purpose and effect of such dedication requirements is not to burden the landowner's right to use his
      land, but rather to enable him to put it to a use which, because of the unreasonable burden it would thrust upon
      public facilities, would be otherwise impermissible. Courts applying this rule have required that the public
      facility for which dedication is required be reasonably related to or "specifically and uniquely attributable" to
      the needs expected to be generated by the proposed development. <i>See, </i><a

      <p><a href="#r[6]" name="[6]" onclick="scife_fn_clicked();">[6]</a> The substantial need the service road is
      designed to serve is not that of the landowners; their properties abut Route 60, and they already have full
      access. It is true that the landowners may derive some benefit if the service road is completed in its entirety,
      an eventuality conditioned upon individual landowner decisions to develop every parcel in B-2. The Board's
      evidence shows that the primary need for the service road arises from the projected increase in tourist travel
      between Williamsburg and Busch Gardens.</p>

      <p><a href="#r[8]" name="[8]" onclick="scife_fn_clicked();">[8]</a> On May 18, 1974, the Colonial Williamsburg
      Foundation entered into a written agreement with the county to deed to the county or its designees a portion of
      its land adjoining the southern boundary of the subject property. On brief, the Board said that "because the
      Ordinance . . . required the landowners to dedicate 55' of their property fronting on U. S. Route 60 to the
      County. . . for an access road . . . the County made arrangements to add a strip of land to the landowners'
      property to the south insofar as possible to replace the strip of land that it was restricting to the north." The
      record shows that not all landowners will receive an acreage rebate equivalent to the acreage dedicated, and the
      record is devoid of evidence showing equivalent values. We accept the Board's concession that what it called on
      brief "a compensatory strip of land" is not a constitutionally sufficient substitute for "just compensation".</p>

      land is subdivided as defined in Code Â§ 15.1-465, local governments are empowered by necessary implication of the
      language of the statutes to require, as the price of subdivision approval, <i>dedications</i> for access roads or
      other public facilities, we reserve decision on that question as it pertains to the power to require <i>construction</i>
      or <i>maintenance</i> of such facilities.</p>
